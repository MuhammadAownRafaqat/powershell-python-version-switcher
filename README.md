# powershell-python-version-switcher
A PowerShell utility to quickly switch between installed Python versions by updating the PATH.

This PowerShell script defines a helper function `Set-PythonVersion`
that allows you to switch between multiple installed Python versions
by updating the PATH environment variable for the current session.

It is useful for developers who work with multiple Python versions
and want a fast, command-based way to switch between them without
changing system-wide environment variables.

Note:
This script assumes Python is installed in:
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\

Modify paths if your installation differs.
